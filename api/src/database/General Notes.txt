To allow for somewhat complex return types from the database, a number of 'TableNameView' views are set up.
These are handy because any filtering that applies to a table below can be performed in one query.
(e.g. all commentThreads with 'draw' in the snippet body)

The only exception to this, are the one-to-many relations that exist (submission-file, thread-comment)
It is currently impossible to collect these at the same time as the other data.
These can be added later, with dedicated methods that take the first query call as input.

Inserting, updating and deleting can (generally) only be done within a single table.
to return a full response, the WITH query AS (insert|update|delete ... RETURNING *) syntax is used.
The result of this query is the input for the view (for that table). (the modified table name is replaced with `qurey as`)

The input to the most methods is a large object that, besides the table fields, contains more options to configure the queries.
these include:
	limit: set a limit to what number of items is returned. (only used in selects)
	offset: start at location `offset` in the list of items with returning (only used in selects)
	client: when doing transactions, a client should be inserted, to let the query use that client when connecting to the database.
